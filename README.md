# Frontend of My Fullstack DomiArt Project - Gallery website for an artist.

The project is mainly Vue.js, 
The entire website is compatible for mobile.

All images are from the artist, icon8 or generated by AI and allowed for commercial use.
I'd say my most complicated part of the work was the landscape Gallery,
as this is a gallery for an artist, i felt the Images had to be displayed in their true aspect ratio,
and also in a way that is artsy and not just image cards.

This made it difficult to adjust and change images on a whiff, as there is a need to order and paginate the images in the landscape component.
